Day 1 (5 August)
Html basics. I've read the 1st 5 sections which covered html tags,to name a few tags i learnt to use, date-date or time, br-break line or cut to next line,i-italics, em- also does italics but its meant to be used for emphasising text so dont confuse them. also &lt and &gt are used to create lesser than and greater than symbols inside the text as the actually buttons for them are recognised by browsers and coding applications as an error? or something to that effect. 
I've also learnt how to link a url to a webpage and how to adjust the size of an image

Day 2 (6 August)
I've learnt that html isnt just some random lines of code put together to make a website. Theres a scructure to html that allows it to work properly.
you have to start with identifying which language you are using. Then move into creating the header and footer, which contains the metadata or rather the links to the logo's, navigation, documents and the site name as these are the 1st things to load. Thereafter you have the articles or the text that will be displayed, i.e title of the text, subtitles, content, author/s and the date. following the Articles we have the section, which contains the subheadings(), wrapped text. lastly we have the Aside, this contains the structure of the web page. The visual layout of the webpage, i.e side bar, color, shape, size.

Day 3 (7 August)
Today i managed to complete HTML 101 and started to learn css. thus far i understand the basics of HTML and i'm confident enough to create the general elements and attributes for it, the tabular section of HTML is still new to me but in time i will be able to make use of it. CSS is a bit different to HTML in the sense that it relies on html to do anything. An analogy for these to coding languages would best be explain as you website is the water, the html is the coffee, the css is the sugar. While you can create a website with HTML only, it is highly recommended that you include some CSS to add unique color and design to set your website apart from others.

Day 4 (8 August)
I finished the HTML and CSS 102. Most of it is still a bit new to me but i do understand how to use it, knowing exactly where and when thats up for debate. i think that if i continue to practice with hmtl and css it'll be like 2nd nature by the time we're sent of to the various workplaces.
